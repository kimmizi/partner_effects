# partner_effects
As my bachelor thesis, I replicated and complemented prior findings of partner effects in initial romantic attraction with cross-validated machine learning models (lasso regression and Random Forest) trained on personality traits and actual behavior. In addition, I identified meaningful predictors associated with a person’s attractiveness. 

## Abstract
Why are some people perceived as more desirable than others? The overall goal of this study is
to replicate, complement and extent prior findings of partner effects in initial romantic attraction with
cross-validated machine learning models trained on self-reports and actual behavior. This study used a
sample consisting of 186 undergraduate students, who participated in speed-dating events in 2007. They
filled out a questionnaire capturing personality traits and after each speed-date they completed an
interaction record questionnaire. Results of this study are that partner effects in initial romantic attraction
can be predicted using a cross-validated machine learning model. Including flirting behavior in the model
did not lead to significant better predictions. The nonlinear machine learning model (Random Forest)
and the linear machine learning model (Lasso Regression) provided both (very) large effect sizes but did
not significantly differ in their performance. Consistent predictors of both models were the partner’s
physical attractiveness, mate value, sociosexuality, promotion (regulatory focus), general flirting, and
agentic flirting. The results of this study are relevant for understanding interpersonal perception in dating
contexts.
